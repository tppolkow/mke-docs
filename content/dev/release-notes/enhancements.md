Detail on the enhancements introduced in MKE 4k 4.1.1 includes:

- **MKE 4k child clusters with Mirantis k0rdent Enterprise 1.1.0**

  MKE 4k 4.1.1 includes Mirantis k0rdent Enterprise 1.1.0 by default, thus
  enabling the seamless deployment of MKE 4k child clusters across multiple
  providers from an MKE 4k mothership cluster. Users can start with the default
  cluster template, or work with a Mirantis representtive to create a custom
  cluster template to meet your specific needs.

  To ensure consistency, the mothership cluster monitors and corrects
  configuration drift for MKE 4k services and resources. New clusters
  automatically adopt a standardized default configuration, which simplifies
  multi-cluster deployments across clouds or on-prem environments.

  Refer to [MKE 4k child clusters](../../concepts/child-clusters) and
  [Configure child clusters](../../configuration/mke-4k-child-clusters) for more information.

- **Custom CA certificates for air-gapped environments**

  With the 4.1.1 release, MKE 4k now supports custom registries with TLS
  certificates from private, self-signed Certificate Authorities (CAs). This is
  critical for air-gapped environments, as it enables secure image management
  without internet access, which is ideal for customer segments that must run
  the product in isolation, such as finance or government institutions.

  Refer to [TLS certificates](../../configuration/tlscertificates/) for more information.

- **Improved upgrades, including dry run functionality**

  Upgrading to 4.1.1 from MKE 3.7, MKE 3.8, and MKE 4k 4.1.0 is now a smoother
  process. In particular, it brings key MKE 3 features forward, and thus closes
  the adoption gap for MKE 3 users, offering minimal disruption and enhanced
  stability. In addition, with the new dry-run feature you can simulate
  upgrades, validate configurations, and identify potential issues before you
  upgrade, to ensure that you production clusters remain reliable.

  Refer to [Perform the Upgrade](../../upgrade-from-mke-3x/perform-migration)
  and [Upgrade Compatibility
  checks](../../upgrade-from-mke-3x/compatibility-checks) for more information.
<br><br>
- **Custom CNI enablement, including Calico Enterprise**

  The 4.1.1 release comes complete with Calico OSS CNI for robust networking,
  and it now enables custom CNIs such as Calico Enterprise. The flexibility
  provided by this function allows you to leverage advanced network policies
  and observability, tailoring Kubernetes networking to your needs while also
  maintaining CNCF-certified reliability.

  Refer to [Configure CNI Providers](../../configuration/container-network-interface/configure-cni-providers/#calico-oss) for more information.
